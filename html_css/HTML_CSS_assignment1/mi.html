<p>Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose medium is sound. General definitions of music include common elements such as</p><p>pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation),</p>
      <p> dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture</p>
      <p>(which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>
      <p>Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. </p>
      <p>Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely </p>
      <p>instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.</p>
